# flymake-proselint

This package makes it possible to use [proselint](http://proselint.com/) with Emacs built-in Flymake.

## Getting started

`flymake-proselint` is listed on [GNU ELPA](http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/flymake-proselint.html), so you can use `M-x list-packages` to
install it.

Then you just need to activate it in the modes you want your prose to be
checked with something like:

``` emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda ()
                            (flymake-mode)
                            (flymake-proselint-setup)))
```
